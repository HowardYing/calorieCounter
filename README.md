# Calorie Counter
This asks the user to input general physiological information about themselves. This includes, height, weight, activity, gender, etc. The program uses these factors to determine a recommended daily calorie intake to maintain or lower the current weight. A logging feature for daily calorie intake is included, with data persistence across different sessions.
